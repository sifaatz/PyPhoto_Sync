# PyPhoto_Sync
Helps syncronizing photos from several devices


Main Idea: 
* Create index of existing file in destination
* compare sources like camera, mobile, hdd... with index and copy only new files into the destination
* PLUS: sort files into folders by yyyy-mm and differentiate between photos, videos, screenshots or just stuff from web
